## Notes
### VirtueMart "Safe Path"
VirtueMart uses a folder for storing invoices and downloadable files you eventually offer for sale. You must configure the path to this folder referred to as "Safe Path". For security reasons, it is recommended that this folder is outside of the public website folders.
[Read more about how to setup the safe path](setuphttp://docs.virtuemart.net/faqs/110-how-to-set-the-safe-path.html).
